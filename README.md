# BG snm3C-seq MERFISH paper Analysis
This repo is meant to house the analysis of the spatial data (MERFISH) generated for the snm3C-seq Basal Ganglia paper as part of the BICAN consortium. 

The main preprocessing steps are completed by [SPIDA](https://github.com/a3klein/SPIDA) version 1.0.0. 

## Main analysis files
- The templates used to annotate the data : [annotation]("https://github.com/a3klein/BG_snm3c-seq_MERFISH/tree/main/annotation")
- The batch scripts used to run SPIDA for preprocessing : [image_processing]("https://github.com/a3klein/BG_snm3c-seq_MERFISH/tree/main/image_processing")
- The notebooks to integrate the methylation imputation : [methylation]("https://github.com/a3klein/BG_snm3c-seq_MERFISH/tree/main/methylation")
- The notebooks / templates / batch scripts to run the main spatial analysis, including CCPA and gradient detection. [spatial_analysis]("https://github.com/a3klein/BG_snm3c-seq_MERFISH/tree/main/spatial_analysis")
- The code to generate all of the figures in the paper : [FIGURES]("https://github.com/a3klein/BG_snm3c-seq_MERFISH/tree/main/FIGURES")

## Manuscript
