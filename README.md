# BG snm3C-seq MERFISH paper Analysis
This repo is meant to house the analysis of the spatial data (MERFISH) generated for the snm3C-seq Basal Ganglia paper as part of the BICAN consortium. 

The main preprocessing steps are completed by [SPIDA](https://github.com/a3klein/SPIDA) version 1.0.0. 

## Main analysis files
`annotation` - The templates used to annotate the data. \n
`image_processing` - The batch scripts used to run SPIDA for preprocessing. \n
`methylation` - The notebooks to integrate the methylation imputation. \n
`spatial_analysis` - The notebooks / templates / batch scripts to run the main spatial analysis, including CCPA and gradient detection. \n
`FIGURES` - The code to generate all of the figures in the paper. \n

## Manuscript
All other analysis for the paper are present on [BG_snm3C-seq](https://github.com/DingWB/BG_snm3C-seq).
